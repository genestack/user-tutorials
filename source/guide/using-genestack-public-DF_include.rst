Public data flows
-----------------

On our platform, you can find a range of public data flows we have prepared for
our users. We cover most of the common analysis types:

- Single-cell Transcriptomic Analysis
- Genetic Variation Analysis
- Whole Exome Sequencing Analysis
- Isoform Expression Statistics
- Whole Genome Methylation Analysis
- Gene Expression Statistics
- Affymetrix Microarray Quality Control
- Targeted Sequencing Quality Control
- Mapped Reads Quality Control
- Raw Reads Quality Control
- Agilent Microarray Quality Control
- Unspliced Mapping
- Spliced Mapping

Clicking on the data flow will take you to the Data Flow Editor where you can
add source files and reference genomes. When you have chosen your files,
click on "Run data flow" to go to the Data Flow Runner. If you do not want to
change any settings, you can click "Start initialization now". To tweak the
parameters and settings of the applications, select "Delay initialization until
later". To change the settings, click on the name of the application in the
data flow. This will take you to the application page, where you can select
"Edit parameters" and introduce your changes. When you are done introducing
your changes, go back to the data flow and initialize your computations.
