Public data flows
-----------------

On our platform, you can find a range of public data flows we have prepared for
our users. We cover most of the common analysis types:

- Whole Genome Methylation Analysis
- Whole Exome Sequencing Analysis
- Single-cell Transcriptomic Analysis
- Isoform Expression Statistics
- Genetic Variation Analysis
- Gene Expression Statistics

- Targeted Sequencing Quality Control
- Raw Reads Quality Control
- Mapped Reads Quality Control
- Agilent Microarray Quality Control
- Affymetrix Microarray Quality Control

- Unspliced Mapping
- Spliced Mapping

Clicking on the data flow will take you to the Data Flow Runner where you can
add source files and a reference genome. When you have chosen your files,
click on the button marked as "Run data flow". If you do not want to
change any settings, you can click "Start initialization now". To tweak the
parameters and settings of the applications, select "Delay initialization till
later". To change the settings, click on the name of the application in the
data flow. This will take you to the application page, where you can select
"Edit parameters" and introduce your changes. When you are happy with parameters,
go back to the data flow and start initializion.
