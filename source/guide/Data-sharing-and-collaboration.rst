Sharing Data and Collaboration
------------------------------

You can share everything you do on the platform: files, scripts,
results, data flows,  and import templates. Sharing on Genestack is
managed using groups. To create a new collaborative group, click on your
username (your email address) in the upper right corner of the page and
go to **Manage Groups**.

Learn more on how to Create and Manage Groups here: https://genestack.com/tutorial/managing-and-sharing-data/

To share a file with your group, select it, and click on the “Share”
button that appears in the top left corner of the page and follow the
instructions. You have the option of giving members the ability to edit
the files in addition to viewing them. This does not stop them from
using the shared files in data flows, but it does prevent them from
editing parameters in files that are not yet initialized as well as
metadata for both initialized and uninitialized files.

If a file is shared with a group, members
can find that file in searches and file provenance, however it will not
be present in the main group folder. This helps reduce clutter while
maintaining functionality for dependencies and intermediate files. If
you want the shared file to be present in the group folder you need to
use the “Link” button from the sharing popup. All files you share with
other people, along with all files shared with you, will be located in
the “Shared with me” folder.
