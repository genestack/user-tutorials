Metadata Management

Metainfo Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|Metainfo editor.png|

Using Metainfo Editor app, you can import metainfo from spreadsheet and
add specific attributes to your metadata. Moreover, you can decide that
for this particular experiment, you want to use a different template. To
do that, click on the name of the template in the top right corner of
the page and select “Change template”. You can also use the existing
template to import more files or share this template with your
colleagues.

How to access the app?

Select the assays of interest, right click on them and in “Manage”
section choose “Edit metainfo”.

Metainfo Templates

Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: What is a dictionary?

Dictionaries are the special files including biological terms imported
from external ontologies or  controlled vocabularies created by
Genestack. These files are used for curation of public experiments and
for editing metainfo created or imported files.

Sharing Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Organisations, groups, users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sharing and permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can share everything you do on the platform: files, scripts,
results, data flows,  and import templates. Sharing on Genestack is
managed using groups. To create a new collaborative group, click on your
username (your email address) in the upper right corner of the page and
go to “Manage Groups”.

Learn more on how to Create and Manage Groups here: https://genestack.com/tutorial/managing-and-sharing-data/

To share a file with your group, select it, and click on the “Share”
button that appears in the top left corner of the page and follow the
instructions. You have the option of giving members the ability to edit
the files in addition to viewing them. This does not stop them from
using the shared files in data flows, but it does prevent them from
editing parameters in files that are not yet initialized as well as
metadata for both initialized and uninitialized files.

If a file is shared with a group, members
can find that file in searches and file provenance, however it will not
be present in the main group folder. This helps reduce clutter while
maintaining functionality for dependencies and intermediate files. If
you want the shared file to be present in the group folder you need to
use the “Link” button from the sharing popup. All files you share with
other people, along with all files shared with you, will be located in
the “Shared with me” folder.
