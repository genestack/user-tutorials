Introduction to bioinformatics
==============================

Bioinformatics can be defined as the application of computational
techniques to make sense of and organize large-scale biological
information.

With costs of sequencing dropping below $1000 per genome, enormous
amounts of sequencing data are being produced each day. Soon enough, it
will not just be trained bioinformaticians who will need to analyse omics
data daily. Doctors, lab technicians, researchers, PhD students,
postdocs: anyone working with personalised medicine, genetics-related
research, drug design or biotechnology will have to be able to perform
at least basic omics analysis.

Luckily, during the last five years, a range of bioinformatics platforms
emerged on the market promising to lower the entry barrier to bioinformatics.
Genestack is one of these platforms and our
community edition is freely available online for academic and
non-commercial users.

No coding skills are required to use the platform, but a basic
level of understanding of the sequencing data analysis process and the
tools involved is crucial for correct data analysis and results
interpretation.

bioinformatics, we recommend this introductory article_ by N.M.
