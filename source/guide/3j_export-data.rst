Data Export
===========

As you know, once you upload files on Genestack they “lose” their format
and become meaningful biological objects. This means that you don’t need
to worry about formats during data analysis.

Export Data For Microarray Assays 

This application allows users to export microarrays from public or
shared experiments. The app generates a special download link which can
be sent to your colleagues, even if they aren’t registered on Genestack.

How to access the app?

You can find it in the Manage section after right-clicking on the files
you wish to export. \ :sup:``[bb] <#cmnt54>`__`[bc] <#cmnt55>`__`

Export Data for other data types
--------------------------------

Complete data export features are currently under development. However,
you can contact our team to export files on demand.
