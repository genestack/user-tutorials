Welcome Page Map
----------------

After you login, you’ll see your **Welcome Page**. Let’s cover the basics.

The very top of the page is static and you can always refer to it. Clicking
on the Genestack logo in the top left corner of any platform page will take
you back to the Welcome Page. This option is customizable: you can instead
have it link to the File manager.

Clicking on your username (your email address) in the top right corner of the
page will give you access to your profile, allow you to manage your
applications, groups, and users or logout of the platform.

You can watch a video on managing users on Genestack here:

**Tasks** links to the **Task Manager**, which will be described later in the
guide. 

In the bottom right corner of the page you can see the **chat window**. Please
message us whenever you have any questions or want to make any suggestions.

Wherever you are on the platform, you can also access a **shortcuts menu**.
It’s an easy way to reach most commonly used apps and folders. Genestack
Import, Manage apps, Manage groups, Experiment Browser as well as the folders
for Created and Imported files can all be found here. To access the shortcuts
menu simply move your mouse cursor to the left hand side of any page.

Let’s go back to the Welcome Page. Here you can find the following sections:

1. **Run Data Flow** includes a collection of **most commonly used data
   flows** we have prepared for our users.
2. **Recent Results** shows you the files you have recently created
   (including their initialization or completion status).
3. **Browse data** section allows you to browse through public, private and
   shared data with **Experiment Browser** which allows you to search through
   the wealth of your data using complex queries.
   In the Browse Data section, you’ll also find a link to the File Manager
   (home), as well as often used folders: Uploaded files, Imported files,
   Created files and Exports.
4. **Import data** section allows you to import your data using either a
   customized or a default template.
5. **Tutorials** explain the most common analysis types in greater detail.
