In this tutorial, we would like to introduce you to the core features of
Genestack Platform. You will learn how our system deals with files, how
it helps you organise and manage your data and how to share data with
your colleagues. You will see how easy it is to work on private and
public data simultaneously and seamlessly, and how to reproduce complex
analyses with data flows, a built-in mechanism for capturing and
replaying your research.
