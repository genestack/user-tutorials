Lets now identify microbial species and their abundances in the microbiome
samples.

Sample count: 8
Reads per sample: 377,823
Clustered reads per sample: 313,487


"Group samples by" option lets you change 


Display absolute OTU counts
Hide unidentified OTUs
Hide partially identified OTUs



The plot displays the relative abundance of OTUs at a highest taxonomic
resolution: genus (L6 tab) and species (L7 tab). You can change resolution to
the L2 level to see what phyla are the most abundant across the samples.

About the plot, tabs
Taxonomic resolution levels: L2, L3, L4 and so forth.





At low taxonomic resolution, the composition of microbial communities is
similar between samples. Bacteroidetes (8,30–86.73%), Firmicutes (1.46–650,49%)
and Proteobacteria (1,38–64,96%) are the most abundant phyla across most of
the samples, followed by Actinobacteria (0,02-15,14%) and Fusobacteria
(0-10,33%).

This is consistent with the paper results:
