Welcome to the Genestack user guide!

Genestack is a platform to manage, process and visualize biological data,
with a focus on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarray data.
Genestack is one of the bioinformatic platforms promising to lower
the entry barrier to bioinformatics. Our community edition is freely
available online for academic and non-commercial users.

No coding skills are required to use the platform, but a basic
level of understanding of the sequencing data analysis process and the
tools involved is crucial for correct data analysis and results
interpretation.

This guide is intended for end-users of the platform. It covers the key
concepts of the platform, a detailed walkthrough of the user interface
and of the different bioinformatics pipelines available on Genestack.
