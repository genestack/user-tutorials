Genestack User Guide
####################

We work hard to make Genestack Platform the most intuitive and
user-friendly bioinformatics software. That being said, bioinformatics
is always going to be challenging at times and anyone doing any type of
NGS data analysis has hundreds of questions running through their head.

In this guide we will answer any questions you might have, help you
troubleshoot problems and eventually teach you how to make the most out
of our platform.

We wrote this guide for everyone: whether it’s your first or hundredth
time doing bioinformatics you will find something useful here. We will
cover general aspects of bioinformatics and talk about the specifics of
our platform.

Before we begin, we’d like to remind you that the community edition of
Genestack Platform is meant to be used by academic and non-commercial
users. The Enterprise edition is designed for our commercial users who
will benefit from features such as a broad range of customization
options, tech support or running the platform on or off the cloud, to
name a few things. If you have any further questions, please get in
touch with our team at contact@genestack.com
